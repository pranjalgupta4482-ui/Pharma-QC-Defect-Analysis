 Quality Control Defect Analysis & ML Risk Prediction

 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes quality control defect data from pharmaceutical manufacturing
to identify defect patterns, assess severity levels, and predict high-risk defects
using machine learning.

The insights are visualized using Power BI, while ML predictions are generated
using Python.
